# Weather-Dashboard
## Description
This was an application where you had to make get routes to fetch information from the WeatherDashboard API. This application uses Bootstrap for laying out the page and it uses jQuery and moment JS for time and dates. The weather application grabs the current weather of the city you search and the forecast for the next 5 days for that city. It shows temperature, wind, Humidity, and UV. 

## User Story
AS A traveler</br>
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities</br>
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly</br>

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs</br>
WHEN I search for a city</br>
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history</br>
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city</br>
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed</br>
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city</br>
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity</br>
